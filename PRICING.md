# WCAG Compliance Platform — Pricing & Objections (Final Direction)

## 1) Buyer Objections & Internal Thoughts (Simulated)

### A. Small Website Owners / Solo Operators
- Thoughts: “I’m probably not a lawsuit target”; “Accessibility sounds expensive”; “I just want obvious fixes”; “I don’t need perfection.”
- Objections: “Overkill”; “Why not free like Lighthouse?”; “What if I can’t fix everything?”
- Converts: Low-cost entry, plain language, no fear tactics, optional upgrades.

### B. Agencies / Freelancers
- Thoughts: “I want something to show clients”; “I don’t want to be the accessibility expert”; “I need to look covered.”
- Objections: “Will this slow me down?”; “Can I white-label?”; “What if a client sues me?”
- Converts: Clean reports, repeatable process, risk-reduction positioning (not certification).

### C. Vendors Selling to Government / Enterprise
- Thoughts: “Procurement asks WCAG”; “Legal is nervous”; “I need documentation.”
- Objections: “Is this defensible?”; “Does this satisfy RFPs?”; “Who stands behind it?”
- Converts: Methodology transparency, risk classification, evidence retention, named contact.

### D. Government / Large Enterprises
- Thoughts: “We don’t want to be a test case”; “Price is secondary to coverage.”
- Objections: “Is this recognized?”; “Audit-ready?”; “Who is accountable?”
- Converts: Assurance tiers, human involvement, clear scope/disclaimers, contract language.

## 2) Pricing Psychology
- You sell reduced uncertainty and risk, not just scans.
- Cheap plans = access; expensive plans = assurance.
- Target feeling: “Affordable to start, expensive to depend on.”

## 5) In-Product Messaging (Upgrade Nudges)
- “This site appears to have **high public exposure**.”
- “Recommended compliance level: **Professional / Compliance+**.”
- “Some issues require **human interpretation**.”
- “Higher assurance levels provide stronger documentation.”
- Never shame, threaten, or promise immunity.

## 6) Non-Negotiable Disclaimers
- “This tool does not certify WCAG compliance.”
- “Findings are automated and AI-assisted.”
- “Legal interpretation is outside scope.”
- “Accessibility is an ongoing process.”

## 7) Final Strategic Call
- Serve individuals and enterprises; monetize assurance, not scans.
- Price ladder mirrors risk tolerance.
- Position: “We help organizations understand and defend their accessibility posture—at whatever level of risk they operate.”
